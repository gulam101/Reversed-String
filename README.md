# Reversed-String
I wanted to take a look at some technical questions in C#

For the technical question I had to reverse engineer it by breaking the code and then understanding how it works. I got the question on the web and then changed some lines.
It was easier than I expected, and this was because it was a very clean method. However, I think I might change it and then add a forloop instead because this would have been a better method of making it simple to read. 

The application was made using the console app because it is easier however, I can turn it into a GUI but for this code I just wanted to reverse engineer the code to understand how it works.

Things to add in the future:
Adding user input instead of having a simple word already available
Replacing the IF statement with a forloop
Also adding in a way to check if the user has added something that the application cannot understand.
